      <p class="h1">Dive into the world of Air Traffic Control.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>In Masta ATC, you will assume the role of an air traffic controller, tasked with managing the flow of aircraft
        within a designated airspace, ensuring their safe takeoff, flight, and landing.</p>
      <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>This is just a game that simulates the activities of an Air Traffic Controller (ATC); at no point should it be
        regarded as formal training or education for performing the role of a real ATC.</p>
      <h2>Notes</h2>
      <h3>Paused game</h3>
      <p>At the beginning of the game, it is paused due to audio permission issues. You will need to start it by pressing the large red button located at the bottom right corner of the game screen.</p>
      <h3>Auto Takeoff</h3>
      <p>The game features an automatic takeoff system: <b>when there are no flights in 
        takeoff procedures and have enough space in approachs</b>, the next flight on the Departures list will be indicated for takeoff. You must control the altitude and destination.</p>
      <h2>User Interface</h2>
      <p>The game interface is divided into two main sections: the Game Map (on the left) and the Control Panel (on the
        right).</p>
      <h3>Game Map</h3>
      <p>The map provides a visual representation of the airspace, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Airport and Runways</b>, located at the center of the map:
          <img class="imag" src="/img/runway.jpg" alt="Runway">
        </li>
        <li><b>Flights</b>, represented by RED DOT rounded by a safety distancie circle, each with its call sign, speed
          (kts), and altitude (ft):
          <img class="imag" src="/img/dep.jpg" alt="Departure"><img class="imag" src="/img/arr.jpg" alt="Arrival">
        </li>
        <li><b>Waypoints</b>, key points on the map that planes can use to navigate:
          <img class="imag" src="/img/waypoint.png" alt="Waypoint">
        </li>
        <li><b>ILS Zones</b>, areas around the airport to start the approach procedure:
          <img class="imag" src="/img/ils-zone.png" alt="ILS Zone">
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Control Panel</h3>
      <p>This panel includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Flight List</b>, displays ongoing flights, with details such as call sign, destination, speed, and
          altitude in each card.</li>
        <li>White border indicates an active flight. Red border indicates an inactive flight.</li>
        <li>Green is for departures, purple for arrivals.<br />
          <img src="/img/flightlist.png" alt="Flight List">
        </li>
        <li><b>Flight Controls</b>, allows you to adjust the Heading, Direct to Waypoint Speed, and Altitude for the
          selected flight.<br /><br />
          <img src="/img/control.png" alt="Control Panel">
          
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Main Functions</h2>
      <h3>Selecting a Flight</h3>
      <p>Click on a flight on the map or in the flight list of the control panel to select it. This will enable you to
        adjust its parameters from the control panel.</p>
      <h3>Modifying Flight Parameters</h3>
      <p>Once a flight is selected, you can modify its parameters:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Heading:</b> Defines the direction in which the plane should move. Note that you must use nautical
          degrees: 0 for North, 90 for East.<br />
          <img src="/img/heading.png" alt="Heading">
        </li>
        <li><b>Direct to:</b> Orders the plane to head directly to a specified waypoint on the map.</li>
        <li><b>Heading and Direct to Waypoint are mutually exclusive.</b> When you input a value in one of them, the other will be cleared.</li>
        <li><b>You can indicate a CallSign (Flight number) as a waypoint, to follow them.</b></li>
        <li><b>Speed:</b> Adjusts the plane's speed in knots. (min 160, max 480).</li>
        <li><b>Altitude:</b> Sets the plane's altitude in feet or Flight Level (feet/100). (min 3000ft, max 20000ft)<br />
          When you set an altitude bellow 10,000ft your speed will be set automatically to 250kts.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Note:</b> You must click the "Send Command" button to give the instructions to the plane.</p>
      <h3>Takeoff and Landing</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Remember the Auto Takeoff feature!</b></li>
        <li><b>Landing:</b> For landing, when a plane is in an ILS Zone below 3500ft, you can authorize its approach
          procedure by clicking on the yellow icon on the flight card <img class="imag" src="/img/appicon.png" alt="">
          or by checking the box in the flight control <img class="imag" src="/img/appbtn.png" alt=""><br />The flight
          will approach the assigned runway and land automatically.</li>
        <li><b>Abort Landing:</b> When a flight is in approach procedure, you can click the <b>Abort Approaching</b>
          button anytime for cancel approach, your flight will be keep their current heading, but set their speed to
          250kts and
          altitude to 3000ft.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Useful Tips</h2>
      <h3>Prioritize Safety:</h3>
      <p>Ensure to maintain a safe distance between planes at all times. A safe distance means not letting the circles
        touch with an altitude difference of less than 1000ft.</p>
      <h3>Manage Efficiently:</h3>
      <p>Optimize routes and altitudes to keep air traffic orderly and efficient.</p>
      <h3>Pay Attention to Waypoints:</h3>
      <p>Use waypoints to guide planes effectively through the airspace. If a plane reaches a waypoint without an
        additional command, it will fly in circles near the waypoint.</p>
        <h2>Scoring System</h2>
        <p>When a takeoff has reached its destination: 50 points.</p>
        <p>For a correct landing: 100 points.</p>
        <p>For letting a flight exit the map: -1,000 points.</p>
